# Hack Reactor Front End Capstone Project

## OVERVIEW
This is a project we did at Hack Reactor where we built a Product Description page for an e-commerce website.

## DESCRIPTION
Our app is a single page application built with React. It includes:

(1) Product Overview that displays a large image and important information about the product

(2) Questions & Answers that allows the user to view and submit questions and answers related to the product

(3) Ratings & Reviews that features a sortable list of customer-submitted reviews.

## INSTALLATION

(2) Setup .env file:

Make a copy of .sample-env

Add Port Number, GitHub Token, and ImgBB Token

(3) Run:
```javascript
npm install
npm run build // production bundle

npm run server:dev // nodemon
```
